## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project running.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* pip (Python package installer)
* A running **MySQL** database instance.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lazymonarch/ISIN_InternProject.git
cd isin-management-system
```


### Step 2: Set up Virtual Environment and Dependencies

#### Create and activate virtual environment (Windows/macOS/Linux)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install required Python packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

For security and portability, database credentials are set via a .env file.

Install python-dotenv:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```
Create a file named .env in the root directory and add your database connection string:

 .env (This file is in .gitignore and should NOT be committed to GitHub)
 ```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql+pymysql://root:your_password@127.0.0.1:3333/isin_db"
```

### Step 4: Database Initialization

The application is configured to create the company_details table automatically on startup using models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=database.engine). Ensure your MySQL server is running and accessible before launching the app.

 Running the Application
Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
